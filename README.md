# Deep_learning-GAN
This code implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate handwritten digits similar to those in the MNIST dataset. 

-> define_discriminator: This function defines the discriminator model, which is a convolutional neural network (CNN) responsible for distinguishing between real and generated images. It flattens the output and passes it through a dense layer with a sigmoid activation function, outputting a single value representing the probability of the input being real.

-> define_generator: This function defines the generator model, which takes a latent space vector and generates an image.

-> define_gan: This function creates the GAN model by combining the generator and discriminator.The output of the generator is fed into the discriminator, and the combined model is compiled with a binary cross-entropy loss function.

->load_real_samples: This function loads the MNIST dataset, expands it to 3D, scales the pixel values from [0, 255] to [0, 1], and returns the processed dataset.

->generate_real_samples: Given the dataset and the number of samples (n_samples), it randomly selects n_samples real images from the dataset and generates corresponding labels indicating they are real.

->generate_latent_points: Given the dimension of the latent space (latent_dim) and the number of samples (n_samples), it generates random points in the latent space.

-> generate_fake_samples: It uses the generator model to generate fake images given random points in the latent space. It returns the generated images and corresponding labels indicating they are fake.

-> save_plot: Given a set of generated images, it plots and saves them in a grid format.

-> summarize_performance: This function evaluates the discriminator's performance on real and fake samples, saves a plot of generated images, and saves the generator model.

-> train: This function trains the GAN. It iterates through epochs and, in each epoch, iterates through batches. For each batch, it updates the discriminator weights using real and fake samples, and then updates the generator using the discriminator's error.

-> latent_dim: The dimension of the latent space.
Creating instances of the discriminator, generator, and GAN models.
Loading and processing the MNIST dataset.
Training the GAN:
It trains the GAN using the defined functions and models.
Generating and Displaying Fake Images:
It generates fake images using the trained generator, scales them to [0, 255], and displays them in a 5x5 grid using Matplotlib.
Overall, this code demonstrates how to implement and train a GAN for generating MNIST-like handwritten digits.
